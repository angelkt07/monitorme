<summary class="needscenter">Click to read about MonitorMe</summary>
<p>MonitorMe is a customizable health based app for everyone to track important issues. It was created with classmates at Momentum Learning in Durham NC who share the same values. Like us, you have probably forgotten to provide important information to your doctor in the course of a visit. Providing all relevant information to your health care professional is vital, and real people require real solutions. MonitorMe is here to help. MonitorMe’s solution is to provide a platform for you to customize and organize your information into an easy to read format that can be shared with anyone you choose. Design your own questions and answers using your own terms and verbiage. MonitorMe understands the challenge of having a family member or pet with medical needs that must be tracked, and understands that life is hectic. Let MonitorMe provide you with a secure and organized way to organize your thoughts and information so you can focus on life without added stress. The genesis for MonitorMe was based on the need for a parent to have a customizable app to track symptoms of their child’s chronic migraines due to photophobia. MonitorMe’s design and development team are proud to provide a product that works specifically for you!
