<p>MonitorMe is a customizable health based app for everyone to track important issues. Like us, you have probably forgotten to provide important information to your doctor in the course of a visit. Providing all relevant information to your health care professional is vital, and real people require real solutions. MonitorMe is here to help. MonitorMe’s solution is to provide a platform for you to customize and organize your information into an easy to read format that can be shared with anyone you choose. Use your own questions and answers, populated with your terms. MonitorMe understands the challenge of having a family member or pet with medical needs that have to be tracked, and understands that life can be hectic. Let MonitorMe provide you with a secure and organized way to gather your thoughts and information so you can focus on life without added stress. The genesis for MonitorMe was the need for a parent to have a customizable app to track symptoms of their child’s photophobia, an uncommon medical condition. MonitorMe’s design and development team are proud to provide a product that works specifically for you!

<p>Craig is thrilled to be part of a project that combines coding with the ability to help others. He is commited to making an ever-changing world easier to live in through technology.
