<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<h2>Craig Brunengraber</h2>
<p>ADD A PICTURE</p>
<p>Craig is thrilled to be part of a project that combines coding with the ability to help others. He is commited to making an ever-changing world easier to live in through technology. Monitor-Me was created with classmates at Momentum Leanrning in Durham NC who share the same values. He is passionate about many things, much to his wife's chagrin. These interests include fishing, kayaking, guitar, aquariums, Boston terriers, and general tinkering around his home. Currently residing in Raleigh NC, Craig is most proud of being a husband as well as a father to his three children (2 human, 1 fur child).</p>
